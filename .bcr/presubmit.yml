# We configure this at it seems to be mandatory, but instead of performing of executing integration tests as intended,
# we execute the unit tests. We trust our integration tests in our CI to ensure everything is fine for a release.
# Either way, our integration tests are basd on Python scripts and currently could not be executed by a bazel test
# command either way.
