# The performance gains offered by the lockfile are minimal for us.
# Pinning the dependencies should be superfluous from a reproducibility perspective as the central registry is supposed
# to be immutable for a module X in version Y after it has ben registered with the registry (ignoring the possibility of
# yanking a module). Furthermore, the module resolution is deterministic.
# However, there are several open issues suggesting the lock file will change in one way or another.
# Thus, we don't use the bzlmod locking yet.
