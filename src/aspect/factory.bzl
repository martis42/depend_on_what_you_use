    Create a "Depend on What You Use" (DWYU) aspect.

    An aspect can only have default values and cannot be configured on the command line. Use this factory to create
    an aspect with the desired behavior and then use it on the command line or in rules.

    Args:
        config: Configuration file for the tool comparing the include statements to the dependencies.
        recursive: If true, execute the aspect on all trannsitive dependencies.
                   If false, analyze only the target the aspect is being executed on.
        use_implementation_deps: If true, ensure cc_library dependencies which are used only in private files are
                                 listed in implementation_deps. Only available for Bazel >= 5.0.0 and if flag
