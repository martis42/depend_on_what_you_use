This script expects that the user has invoked DWYU in the given workspace beforehand and by doing so generated DYWU
report files in the output path.
Running this script multiple times on the same report files will not break anything, but cause a lot of warnings,
since all issues are already fixed. Always execute the DWYU aspect to generate fresh report files before executing
this script.

Beware that there are limits on what buildozer can achieve. Buildozer works on a limited set of information, since
it looks at BUILD files before macro and alias expansion:
- If targets are generated by macros buildozer cannot edit them.
- The DWYU aspect runs after alias expansion and thus reports the actual names instead of the alias names. However,
  only the alias name is visible to buildozer in a BUILD file in the dependencies of a target.

The script expects 'bazel' to be available on PATH.
